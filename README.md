# Computer Vision RPS
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. 

Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. 

This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.


# Milestone 2
Used the Teachable Machines web app to train a model to recognize rock, paper and scissor hand pose images. Each class was trained with images of a person showing each option to the camera. The "Nothing" class represents the lack of option in the image. The model was trained with more than 2,000 images to increase the accuracy of the model.

The model was downloaded as a tensorflow model named keras_model.h5, along with the text file containing the labels with the name labels.txt.

The downloaded files contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. These files have been uploaded to the project holder, however, are not files that can be run, and they do not contain anything readable if looked inside. These will need to be loaded into the Python application.

The new files were pushed to the GitHub repository after committing.
